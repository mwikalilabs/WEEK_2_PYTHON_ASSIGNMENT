Python List Manipulation Script
This script demonstrates a series of common list manipulation operations in Python. It starts with an empty list and performs various actions like adding, inserting, extending, and sorting elements to produce a final, modified list.

How it Works
The script executes the following steps in order:

An empty list named my_list is created.

The elements 10, 20, 30, and 40 are appended to the end of the list.

The value 15 is inserted at the second position (index 1).

The list is extended with another list containing [50, 60, 70].

The last element of the list is removed.

The entire list is sorted in ascending order.

The index of the value 30 is found and printed.

Finally, the complete, modified list is printed to the console.

Final Output
When you run the script, you will see the following output:

The index of 30 in my_list is: 3
[10, 15, 20, 30, 40, 50, 60]
